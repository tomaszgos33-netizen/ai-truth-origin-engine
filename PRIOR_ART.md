# PRIOR ART & DEFENSIVE DISCLOSURE

## Project
**AI Origin / AI Truth & Origin Engine™**  
Autor: Tomasz Gos  
Status: public disclosure (defensive publication)

## Purpose of this document

This document serves as a **Prior Art Declaration** and **Defensive Disclosure**  
for concepts, terminology, and system architecture related to:

- AI origin analysis
- AI-generated content fingerprinting
- probabilistic attribution of AI-generated outputs
- non-identifying AI provenance signals

Its purpose is to:
- establish **public timestamped disclosure**
- prevent third-party patent monopolization
- protect conceptual authorship under prior art rules

---

## Disclosed Concepts (Summary)

### 1. AI Origin Fingerprint™
A set of non-identifying statistical and structural features left in content generated by AI systems, independent of:
- model name
- provider
- language
- paraphrasing

The fingerprint does **not** identify the model or user, only the **artificial origin probability**.

---

### 2. AI Origin / Truth Engine™
A conceptual engine combining:
- probabilistic analysis
- statistical residue detection
- uncertainty-aware classification

Used to assess whether content is likely:
- human-generated
- AI-generated
- hybrid / uncertain

---

### 3. Model-agnostic approach
The system explicitly avoids:
- watermarking
- hidden signatures
- proprietary provider cooperation

Instead, it relies on **observable artifacts** in generated output.

---

### 4. Ethical constraint
The system is designed to:
- avoid deanonymization
- avoid user identification
- avoid surveillance use cases

Focus is limited to **content origin**, not authorship.
