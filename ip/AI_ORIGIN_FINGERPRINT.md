## 1. Concept Overview

AI Origin Fingerprint™ is a conceptual framework for identifying
probabilistic traces left by artificial intelligence systems in generated content.

The concept does not identify a specific model, vendor, or architecture.
Instead, it focuses on invariant statistical and structural residues
emerging from machine-generated language.

---

## 2. Core Assumptions

- AI-generated content leaves measurable probabilistic patterns
- These patterns persist across paraphrasing and translation
- The fingerprint is independent of intent or disclosure
- The system does not require access to training data or model internals

---

## 3. What the Fingerprint Is NOT

- It is NOT a watermark
- It is NOT model identification
- It is NOT user tracking
- It is NOT surveillance technology

---

## 4. Potential Application Domains

- Content authenticity assessment
- AI disclosure compliance
- Legal and forensic analysis
- Platform trust & safety
- Academic research on synthetic text

---

## 5. Ethical Boundary

AI Origin Fingerprint™ is designed as an analytical and defensive concept.
It does not attribute authorship to individuals and does not infer intent.
